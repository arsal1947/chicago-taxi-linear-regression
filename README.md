# Chicago Taxi Fare Prediction with Linear Regression

🚖 **Project Overview:**  
This project demonstrates how to use **linear regression** to predict taxi fares in Chicago using Python and machine learning. It uses a real dataset of taxi trips, including features like distance, duration, and payment type.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset used: [Chicago Taxi Trips - Subset](https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/chicago_taxi_train.csv)
- Features included: `TRIP_MILES`, `TRIP_SECONDS`, `FARE`, `COMPANY`, `PAYMENT_TYPE`, `TIP_RATE`

## 💻 Key Concepts Covered
- Loading and exploring data with **Pandas**
- Data visualization with **Plotly**
- Feature selection & correlation analysis
- Building **linear regression models**
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- Training **single-feature and multi-feature models**
- Making predictions and evaluating model accuracy (RMSE)
